  "description": "A completely new approach to inserters: they are placed between machines and belts, which allows you to create much more compact designs!\nEnjoy the beautiful movement of objects that bounce seamlessly where they need to. They function similarly to the Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) and all types of inserters are supported, even from some popular mods.\nWho wants to leave space between assembler and belt anyway?\n<WIP>"
